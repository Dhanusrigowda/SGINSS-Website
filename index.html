    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The National Service Scheme (NSS) Unit of Shanthiniketan College of Science and Management Studies is a platform where students come together with the spirit of service, leadership, and social responsibility. Guided by the motto “Not Me But You,” our NSS unit strives to instill the values of selfless service, teamwork, and nation-building among youth.
          At Shanthiniketan College, we believe that education is not confined to classrooms alone. Through NSS, our volunteers actively engage in community development programs, social awareness campaigns, environmental conservation activities, health camps, and rural outreach initiatives. Every project undertaken helps bridge the gap between the campus and society, nurturing socially responsible citizens who are sensitive to the needs of the community.

Our unit provides students with opportunities to:
     Contribute to community welfare and sustainable development.
     Organize and participate in social awareness programs on health, literacy, and environment.
     Develop leadership skills, discipline, and teamwork.
     Experience the joy of serving the nation selflessly.

         The NSS unit of Shanthiniketan College of Science and Management Studies continues to be a vibrant force, empowering students to bring about meaningful change while shaping their character and personality for a better tomorrow.</p>
